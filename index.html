    <h1 class="sec03">About</h1>
    
    <h2>Why challenges?</h2>
    <p>Medical image processing comprises a large number of tasks, for which new methods are regularly proposed. But, more often than desirable, it is difficult to compare their fitness, as the reported results are obtained on private datasets. Challenges aim to overcome these shortcomings by providing (1) a public dataset that reflects the diversity of the problem and (2) a platform for a fair and direct comparison of methods with suitable evaluation measures. Thus, the scientific progress is promoted (see <a class="reference external" href="http://grand-challenge.org/Why_Challenges/" target="_blank">grand-challenge.org</a> for a detailed rationale behind challenges).</p>

    <h2>Past challenges</h2>
    <p>During the recent years, the need for challenges has been emphasized in the medical image processing community. Especially in the scope of the MICCAI and <a class="reference external" href="http://biomedicalimaging.org" target="_blank">International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging</a> (ISBI) conferences, a number of challenges have been already successfully organized. All of these are collected centrally at <a class="reference external" href="http://grand-challenge.org/" target="_blank">grand-challenges.org</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="sec12">The ISLES challenge</h2>
    <p>With ISLES, we provide such a challenge covering ischemic stroke lesion segmentation in multi-spectral MRI data. The task is backed by a well established clinical and research <a class="reference internal" href=".sec04">motivation</a> and a large number of already existing methods. Each team may participate in either one or both of two sub-tasks: sub-acute ischemic stroke lesion segmentation (SISS) and acute stroke outcome/penumbra estimation (SPES).</p>

    <p class="ml"><strong>SISS</strong>: Automatic segmentation of ischemic stroke lesion volumes from multi-spectral MRI sequences acquired in the sub-acute stroke development stage.</p>
    <p class="ml"><strong>SPES</strong>: Automatic segmentation of acute ischemic stroke lesion volumes from multi-spectral MRI sequences for stroke outcome prediction.</p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>Interested participants can download a set of training cases (<a class="reference internal" href=".sec06">data description</a>) with associated expert segmentations of the stroke lesions to train and evaluate their approach. Shortly before MICCAI 2015 takes place, a set of test cases will be made available and the participants upload their segmentation results (in the form of binary images) as well as a <a class="reference internal" href=".sec11">short paper</a> describing their method. The organizers then evaluate each case and establish a <a class="reference internal" href=".secRanking">ranking</a> of the participating teams. At the MICCAI 2015 conference, the results will be presented in the scope of a workshop and the results discussed together with invited experts. Each team will present their method as a poster and, furthermore, a number of selected teams will have the opportunity to hold a small presentation detailing their method. A number of high ranking and particularly interesting approaches will be invited to contribute to the workshops <a href="http://www.springer.com/lncs" target="_blank">LNCS</a> post-proceedings volume. After the challenge, the organizers and participants will together compose a high-impact journal paper to publish their findings.</p>

<!-- #################################################### MOTIVATION #################################################### -->
<section id="04">
<div class="row content">
	<h1 class="sec04">Motivation</h1>
	<p>
		<!-- What is ischemic stroke? -->
  		Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death and a major cause of disability in industrial countries. In patients who survive, stroke is often associated with high socioeconomic costs due to persistent disability. Its most frequent manifestation is the ischemic stroke, triggered by local thrombosis, hemodynamic factors or embolic causes,
  		<!-- Clinical motivation to segment ischemic stroke (fast diagnosis) -->
  		whose diagnosis often involves the acquisition of brain magnetic resonance (MR) scans to assess the stroke lesion presence, location, extent, evolution and other factors. An automated method to locate, segment and quantify the lesion area would support clinicians and researchers, rendering their findings more robust and reproducible. See <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2012.10.003" target="_blank">Rekik et al. (2012)</a> for a plea for automatic stroke lesion segmentation and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2014.11.011" target="_blank">Maier et al. (2014)</a> [<a lass="reference file" href="pdf/OskarMaier.IschemicStrokeLesionSegmentation.preprint.pdf" target="_blank">preprint</a>] or <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4352610" target="_blank">Kabir et al. (2007)</a> for recent methods.
	</p>

    <h2>Clinical motivation</h2>
    <p>
	    To assess stroke treatments, such as thrombolytic therapy or embolectomy, and to discover suitable markers for sound treatment decisions, large clinical studies tracking the stroke development and outcome under controlled conditions are necessary. Automatic stroke segmentation facilitates the quantification of the stroke lesion over time.
	    The same holds true for quantitative studies aiming to answer the questions 'how an ischemic stroke evolves' and to discover the involved processes.
    </p>
    <p>
        In cases of acute ischaemic stroke, advanced neuroimaging techniques are recommended for a quick, reliable diagnosis and stratification for therapy, which is typically done by assessing the tissue-at-risk. The infarct core (tissue which is already infarcted, or is irrevocably destined to become so) can be identified using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Meanwhile, surrounding tissue that can be potentially rescued (the “penumbra”) is characterized by hypo-perfusion in perfusion-weighted MRI. The imaging is used to assess the ratio of tissue that could potentially be saved, to tissue which is inevitably destined to infarct.  Currently this is performed "by eye" by neuroradiologists, or using off the shelf tools that segment by simple thresholding.  
    </p>

    <h2>Research motivation</h2>
    <p>
	    Lesion to symptom mapping is a neurosciencentific approach used to detect correlations between brain areas and cognitive functions by means of negative samples. It requires manual segmentation of pathologies such as stroke lesions in many MR volumes, which is subject to high inter- and intra-observer variability, diminishing the validity of any gained insight as well as the reproducibility.
	    Furthermore, an automatic method would enable the fully automatic screening of routinely acquired scans. The resulting lesion volume could then be mapped to functional and/or anatomical brain areas, for example to identify suitable study candidates.

    <h1 class="sec05">Rules</h1>		

    <h2>What is required to participate?</h2>
    <p>Each team wishing to participate in the ISLES challenge is required to:</p>
    <ol class="rounded-list green" style="margin-left: 0;">
        <li>Register at the data distribution and evaluation platform (see <a class="reference internal" href=".sec07">participate</a> for more details).</li>
        <li>Upload the test data segmentation results before the deadline (see <a class="reference internal" href=".sec02">dates</a>).</li>
        <li>Submit a short paper describing their method and their results on the training data set (see <a class="reference internal" href=".sec11">short paper</a>).</li>
        <li>Register to the associated MICCAI 2015 workshop and pay the attendance fee (possible right up until the day of the challenge).</li>
        <li>Be present at the workshop with at least one team member and present a poster.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Which methods are called for?</h2>
    <p>All types of automatic stroke lesion segmentation methods are welcome. We specifically do not restrict the participation to new, innovative and unpublished methods, but invite research groups from all over the world to enter their existing method in the competition. Semi-automatic methods are eligible for participation and will appear in the ranking, but out of competition, as it is impossible to rate the influence of the manual steps in a fair manner.</p>

    <h2>Participating in one or both of the sub-task (SISS &amp; SPES)</h2>
    <p>We encourage all teams to apply their method to both of the sub-tasks to highlight its generalization ability. But it is equally possible to submit a specialized approach for each of the task or just to one of them.</p>

    <h2>Organizational structure</h2>
    <p>ISLES is organized as part of a larger, three-part, full-day workshop at the MICCAI 2015 with the following organizational structure:</p>

    <p>The three events should be regarded as a single workshop and a single registration allows to visit all of these and to participate in them. Please note that each part has its own rules of active participation, which can be found on their respective web-pages. The tentative schedule can be found <a class="reference file" href="pdf/tentative_schedule.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, more information will follow.</p>

    <h2>Participation in the Brain Tumor Image Segmentation (BRATS) challenge</h2>
    <p>The organizers of ISLES and BRATS took care to apply the same pre-processing steps to their data, enabling the participants of one of the challenges to furthermore participate in the respectivly other. Especially machine learning based approaches should be easy to adapt. Double contributions are highly welcome and only one registration at the MICCAI 2015 workshop is required.</p>
    
    <h2>Usage of ISLES and BRATS data for the Brain Lesion Segmentation (BrainLeS) workshop</h2>
    <p>Participants are free to use the training data from both, ISLES and BRATS, to evaluate methods submitted to BrainLeS, but are then encouraged to also participate in the respective challenge. In such case, they are not required to submit the short-paper to ISLES respectively BRATS, instead their (accepted) BrainLeS manuscript will suffice, as long as it states the results obtained on the training set.</p>

    <h2 class="sec11">Short paper</h2>
    <p>ISLES requires the participating teams to submit a short-paper of 4 pages in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0" target="_blank">LNCS</a> format, which will be reviewed by the organizers. The text will be distributed among the MICCAI 2015 attendees on the MICCAI 2015 USB drive and uploaded to the challenge result web-page. See <a class="reference internal" href=".sec02">dates</a> for the associated deadlines.

    <h1 class="sec08">Evaluation (SISS & SPES)</h1>
    <p>The evaluation comprises three evaluation measures, each of them highlighting different aspects of the segmentation quality. From the computed evaluation scores, the global ranking of each team is established as described below.</p>
    
    <h2>Segmentation task</h2>
    <p><strong>SISS</strong></p>
    <p>
        Automatic segmentation of the infarcted area in multi-spectral scans of sub-acute ischemic stroke cases. Success will be measured by the evaluation measures detailed below.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>SPES</strong></p>
    <p>
        Automatic segmentation of the "penumbra" in multi-spectral scans of acute ischemic stroke cases. Success will be measured, as for SISS, by the evaluation measures detailed below.
Training and testing data are released with an infarct core (diffusion restriction) and a merged label. These are not used in the challenge but can be employed for private evaluations, e.g. of perfusion-diffusion mismatches.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Expert segmentations</h2>
    <p>All expert segmentation were prepared by experienced raters. For SISS, two ground-truth sets will be made available, for SPES one. The segmentation guidelines for the expert raters were as follows:</p>
    
    <p><strong>SISS</strong></p>
    <p>
        Segmentation was conducted completely manual by an experienced MD. Lesions were classified as sub-acute infarct if pathologic signal was found concomitantly in Flair and DWI images (presence of vasogenic and cytotoxic edema with evidence of swelling due to increased water content). Infarct lesions with signal change due to hemorrhagic transformation were included. Acute infarct lesions (DWI signal for cytotoxic edema only, no FLAIR signal for vasogenic edema) or residual infarct lesions with gliosis and scarring after infarction (no DWI signal for cytotoxic edema, no evidence of swelling) were not included.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>SPES</strong></p>
    <p>
        The label for the perfusion-restriction was segmented by a MD as follows: First, a semi-manual segmentation of the region of interest was done using the currently accepted TMax threshold of 6 seconds (Olivot et al, Stroke 2009; Straka et al., J Magn Reson Imaging 2010; Lansberg et al., Lancet Neurol 2012; Mishra et al., Stroke 2014; Wheeler et al., Stroke 2013) for the production of a preliminary label. Then, morphological operations were applied to the label in order to reduce interpolation artifacts and to correct for unphysiological outliers within the label. Afterwards, the label was hand-corrected again. As a final step, non-brain areas inside the label, such as sulci, ventricles and other CSF collections, were erased from the label. This label represents an underperfused area of potentially salvageable tissue at risk based on the TMax Map (calculated by PMA Assist, segmented in Slicer). TMax is the time it takes for the tissue residue function to reach it's maximum value. TMax is a sensitive parameter reflecting changes in the perfusion state of brain tissue.
    </p>
    <p>
        The label for the diffusion-restriction was segmented by a MD as follows: A semi-manual segmentation of the region of interest was done using the currently accepted ADC threshold of \(600\times 10^-6 mm^2/sec\) (Straka et al., J Magn Reson Imaging 2010, Lansberg et al., Lancet Neurol 2012, Mishra et al., Stroke 2014, Wheeler et al., Stroke 2013). This label represents an area with impairment of energy metabolism and serves as a surrogate to identify the ischemic core of the lesion, which is deemed to undergo infarction.
    </p>
    <p>
        The resulting penumbra (target mismatch = perfusion-restriction label minus diffusion-restriction label) is in line with the MRI profile that suggests salvageable tissue and a favorable response to re-perfusion treatment applied in the multi-center DEFUSE and DEFUSE-II trial (Albers et al., Ann Neurol 2006; Lansberg et al., Lancet Neurol 2012).
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that only the "penumbra" label will be employed in the challenge.
    </p>
    
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    
        <h3>Data upload</h3>
        <p>To upload your training or testing segmentations, navigate to <a href="https://www.virtualskeleton.ch/ISLES/Start2015" target="_blank">https://www.virtualskeleton.ch/ISLES/Start2015</a> and select the respective evaluation button, which will lead you to a page where you can 1. Upload, 2. Evaluate and 3. Activate your segmentations. All of these steps are described in more detail on the evaluation page. Please take care to (1) comply with the required naming format  and (2) give your segmentations expressive names to be able to distinguish between the versions. New and improved segmentations can be uploaded at any time, without any restrictions.</p>

        <h3>Training cases</h3>
        <p>All segmentations selected under "Finished segmentations" will appear in the "Competitive segmentations" listing and and a summary of the results is displayed on the main page (<a href="https://www.virtualskeleton.ch/ISLES/Start2015" target="_blank">https://www.virtualskeleton.ch/ISLES/Start2015</a>), which allows you to compare your results against the competitors. Please be aware that we do not provide a ranking for the training results, as they can easily be tuned and are of limited significance. Likewise, do not be intimidated by teams with very good results - you never now how they might have come to pass and how their method will perform on the testing set.</p>
        <p>Shortly, a new functionality will allow you to download the detailed case-wise results of each team as CSV file to perform your own analyses offline.</p>

        <h3>Testing cases</h3>
        <p>Uploading the segmentation results for the testing set will work similar as for the training data, only you won't be able to see the evaluation results, nor will there be a summary posted on the main page. Thus, tuning of the results should be prevented. Each teams results and their ranking will be revealed in-place during the MICCAI 2015. Afterwards, the results will furthermore be placed on the challenge websites in a frozen table.</p>

        <h3>After the challenge</h3>
        <p>After the challenge, both evaluation systems will stay open. The only difference being that the testing cases will equally be evaluated and displayed immediately. Hence, later results are prone to tuning.</p>
        
    <h2>Evaluation measures</h2>
    <p>Three principal evaluation measures are employed to evaluate the quality of a segmentation compared to the reference ground-truth: The <strong>Dice's coefficient</strong> (DC) denotes the volume overlap, the <strong>average symmetric surface distance</strong> (ASSD) the surface fit and the <strong>Hausdorff distance</strong> (HD) the maximum error. Furthermore, <strong>precision</strong> &amp; <strong>recall</strong> are provided to reveal over- respectively under-segmentation, but will not be used in the computation of the team ranks, as they are indirectly reflected by the DC value.</p>
    
        <h3>Dice's coefficient (DC)</h3>
        <p>The \(DC\) measures the similarity between two datasets. Considering two sets of volume voxels \(A\) and \(B\), the \(DC\) value is given as:</p>
	    <p>$$DC=\dfrac{2|A\cap B|}{|A|+|B|}$$</p>
        <p>A value of 0 indicates no overlap, a value of 1 perfect similarity. During interpretation, it should be kept in mind that the \(DC\) is known to yield higher values for larger volumes i.e. a \(DC\) of 0.9 for lung segmentation is considered average, as is a \(DC\) of 0.6 for multiple sclerosis lesions.</p>
        
        <div class="caption-short">

	        <strong>Fig.:</strong> The two sets \(A\), \(B\) and their union.
        </div>  
	
        <p>Note that the \(DC\) is the same as the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score" target="_blank">F1-score</a>, monotonic in <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index" target="_blank">Jaccard similarity</a> and the harmonic mean of precision &amp; recall. See <a class="reference external" href="http://brenocon.com/blog/2012/04/f-scores-dice-and-jaccard-set-similarity/" target="_blank">here</a> for more details.</p>

        <h3>Average symmetric surface distance (ASSD)</h3>
        <p>The \(ASSD\) denotes the average distance between the volumes surface points averaged over both directions. Considering two sets of surface points \(A\) and \(B\), the average surface distance (\(ASD\)) is given as:</p>
        <p>$$ASD(A,B) = \frac{\sum_{a\in A}min_{b\in B}d(a,b)}{|A|}$$</p>
        <p>with \(d(a,b)\) being the Euclidean distance between the points \(a\) and \(b\). Since \(ASD(A,B)\neq ASD(B,A)\), the \(ASSD\) is then given as:</p>
	    <p>$$ASSD(A,B) = \frac{ASD(A,B)+ASD(B,A)}{2}$$</p>
        <p>It is given in \(mm\), the lower the better, and works equally well for large and small objects.</p>
        
        <h3>Hausdorff distance (HD)</h3>
        <p>The \(HD\) denotes the maximum distance between two volumes surface points and hence denotes outliers, especially when multiple objects are considered. It is defined as:</p>
        <p>$$HD(A,B)=\text{max}\{\max_{a\in A}\min_{b\in B}d(a,b),\max_{b\in B}\min_{a\in A}d(b,a)\}$$</p>
        <p>Similar to the \(ASSD\), the \(HD\) is given in \(mm\) and a lower value denotes a better segmentation.</p>
        
        <h3>Precision &amp; Recall</h3>
        <p>The \(precision\) (also called positive predictive value) and \(recall\) (also known as sensitivity) of two sets are defined as</p>
        <p>$$precision=\dfrac{TP}{TP+FP}$$ and $$recall=\dfrac{TP}{TP+FN}$$</p>
        <p>where \(TP\) (true positive) denotes the overlapping points, \(FP\) (false positive) the wrong segmented points in the segmentation and \(FN\) (false negative) the not segmented points in the reference.</p>
           
        <p>Both measure take values in the range of \([0,1]\). A relatively high precision compared to the recall reveals under-segmentation and vice-versa, as depicted in the following figure:</p>

    <h2 class="secRanking">Ranking</h2>
    <p>To establish a team's rank, the following steps are performed:</p>
    <ol class="rounded-list green" style="margin-left: 0;">
        <li>Compute the \(DC\), \(ASSD\) &amp; \(HD\) values for each case</li>
        <li>Establish each team's rank for \(DC\), \(ASSD\) &amp; \(HD\) separately for each dataset</li>
        <li>Compute the mean rank over all three evaluation measures/case to obtain the team's rank for the case</li>
        <li>Compute the mean over all case-specific ranks to obtain the team's final rank</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This scheme is furthermore detailed in the following figure:</p>

	    <strong>Fig.:</strong> Overview of the ranking schema, click to enlarge.
    </div>  	

        <h3>Very easy or difficult cases</h3>
        <p>By not averaging the actual evaluation measures, but rather the ranks in each, the system is not affected by very difficult or easy cases: If all methods return low results on one case, even a small difference between them will still count in the ranking. Thus, the overall impression of a method will not be distorted.</p>

        <h3>Missing or not processable cases</h3>
        <p>If a case has not been uploaded or could not be processed for some reason, the associated team will be assigned the last place for this case.</p>
        
        <h3>Complete mismatch</h3>
        <p>A complete mismatch (i.e. a \(DC\) value of 0) will be seen as a missing case and treated as detailed above (the obtained \(ASSD\) &amp; \(HD\) values are then ignored).</p>

        <h3>Shared ranks</h3>
        <p>Multiple teams can share a single rank. In such a cases, the following rank will be left empty.</p>
